    "ICD-10-AM (International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision, Australian Modification) is the Australian national standard for classifying diagnoses and health conditions recorded during episodes of patient care. It is an adaptation of the World Health Organisation’s ICD-10 system, expanded and modified to meet the administrative needs of the Australian healthcare system. ICD-10-AM incorporates Australian Coding Standards, providing a framework for consistent clinical documentation, morbidity reporting, hospital funding, and health service evaluation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Diagnostic coding using ICD-10-AM involves translating clinicians’ notes describing medical history, symptoms, and investigations into standardised alphanumeric codes. These codes represent diseases, disorders, and injuries. Clinical coders assign the appropriate codes by reviewing the entire medical record, applying the Australian Coding Standards, and selecting the code that best reflects the patient’s diagnoses and conditions treated or investigated.  \n",
    "Accurate ICD-10-AM diagnostic codes support hospital activity-based funding, health statistics for research, and ensure comparability of clinical data across time and settings. Uniform coding also helps monitor disease trends, evaluate healthcare outcomes, and guide resource allocation.  \n",

The condition established after study may or may not confirm the admitting diagnosis. It is chosen based on the circumstances of care, not just the first condition listed. As an example from the Australian Coding Standards illustrates, when a patient with diabetes and coronary artery disease is admitted with severe chest pain and found to have a myocardial infarction, the myocardial infarction is coded as the principal diagnosis because it led to the hospitalisation.\n",

    "\n",
    "The Asclepius dataset was created from **publicly available case reports** in the PMC-Patients collection (PubMed). Authors of the dataset explained that one of their motivations was to avoid the restrictions of real clinical notes due to privacy risks. While datasets like MIMIC-IV exist, access to them and even products derived from them is “**only limited to credentialed individuals, such as those who have completed CITI training**\".\n",
    "To overcome these limitations, the authors turned to case reports as an open and privacy-safe alternative. However, case reports differ from hospital notes: they are written as polished academic narratives, whereas clinical notes are semi-structured, use abbreviations, and often contain non-standard language and grammatical errors. To make the data usable for training a clinical LLM, the **authors used GPT-3.5 to convert case reports into synthetic discharge summaries** that mimic the style and structure of real EHR documents. To avoid the model's hallucination, they added safeguards to prevent the introduction of new clinical entities. Throughout the process, clinicians reviewed samples to ensure the rewritten notes remained accurate and didn’t introduce any new medical details.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To finetune an LLM capable of performing various clinical NLP tasks, an **instruction–answer pair dataset** is necessary. To build this dataset, the defined eight key clinical NLP tasks were used, and five clinician-verified example questions were created for each. These examples served as seeds for GPT-3.5-turbo, which was given a synthetic clinical note and asked to generate new task-specific instructions. After that, the model was prompted again – this time with both the instruction and the note - to produce the corresponding answer. This pipeline resulted in more than **158,000 instruction–answer pairs** grounded entirely in the synthetic notes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "By doing so, authors bypass regulatory constraints and make the dataset available to the broader research community.\n",
    "\n",
    "*I used GenAI to create a part of the answer. I asked it to create a short version of the author's thought process from the paper to include in the answer. Still, I modified the generated answer to my style and liking; however, it saved me some time because it explained the whole process in a couple of sentences. I provided AI with text from section 2.1 of the paper and asked it to summarise and shorten it.*\n",
